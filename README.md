# Project Discription
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
The California House Price Prediction Regression Project involves using machine learning algorithms to predict the selling price of a house based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant factors. The aim of this project is to create a model that can accurately predict the price of a house given its features, which can be used by real estate agents, buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions.

The project involves collecting a dataset of houses with their corresponding features and selling prices. The data is then preprocessed by cleaning, transforming, and normalizing it for analysis. Various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting are trained on the data to create models that can predict house prices.

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The best-performing model is then selected and used to predict the selling price of new houses.

Finally, the results of the best model are visualized using graphs and charts to provide insights into the factors that influence house prices. This project can be extended by incorporating more features or by using advanced techniques such as Neural Networks or Deep Learning to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

The project workflow typically involves the following steps:

2. Data Ingestion/Collection: Collect data from various sources such as databases, APIs, and web scraping.

3. Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, and normalize the data for analysis. This involves handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

4. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing ones that can improve the performance of the model.

5. Model Selection: Select the appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the problem type and data characteristics.

6. Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed data using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

8. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model into production by integrating it with the existing systems.

9. Monitoring and Maintenance: Monitor the performance of the deployed model and update it periodically to ensure its accuracy and relevance.
